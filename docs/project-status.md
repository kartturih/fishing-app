## Current Phase

Fishing Spot management is complete. Catch management foundation is complete. Catch Photos is implemented and validated. Catch Details View is implemented and validated. Lure Catalog Foundation (MFS-015 / TD-015) is implemented, architecture-reviewed, and validated. Personal Tackle Box Foundation (MFS-016 / TD-016) is implemented, architecture-reviewed, and validated. Assign Lure to Catch (MFS-017 / TD-017) is implemented, architecture-reviewed, and validated. Lure Catalog UX Improvements (MFS-018 / TD-018) is implemented, architecture-reviewed, and validated.

The application now supports full offline CRUD operations for both Fishing Spots and Catches, photo attachments on Catches, a dedicated read-only Catch Details view with a swipeable photo gallery, a shared Lure Catalog with search and filtering browsed by lure model (with a per-model Color Variants view), a Personal Tackle Box that lets an angler track which catalog lures they actually own with an optional personal photo per owned lure, and the ability to assign one of those owned lures to a Catch, shown in Catch Details.

No next milestone has been formally chosen yet — no MFS document has been drafted since MFS-018. See `docs/roadmap.md`'s Current Milestone section for the leading candidate.

* Finland initial camera
* Pan and zoom
* Physical Android support
* GeoJSON-based fishing spot rendering

### Map Controls

* Current Location button
* Add Fishing Spot button
* Settings button
* Selection mode controls

### User Location

* LocationService
* Permission handling
* Current location retrieval
* Camera centering
* User location layer
* Graceful error handling

### Fishing Spots

* Framework-independent FishingSpot domain model
* Drift persistence
* Repository pattern
* GeoJSON-backed marker rendering

* Automatic loading on application startup
* Persistent offline storage

### Fishing Spot Management

* Create from current location
* Create from map
* Crosshair map selection
* Fishing spot naming
* Edit fishing spot names
* Delete fishing spots
* Delete confirmation dialog
* Immediate marker updates
* Immediate marker removal
* Persistent CRUD operations

### Catch Management

* Framework-independent Catch domain model
* Drift persistence
* Repository pattern
* Add catches to fishing spots
* View catches for fishing spots
* Edit catches
* Delete catches
* Species selection
* Optional weight tracking
* Optional length tracking
* Catch date and time selection
* Immediate UI updates
* Persistent offline CRUD operations
* Optional lure assignment: a `Catch` may reference one owned `LureVariant` (schema migrated from version 5 to version 6, `lureVariantId` column on `catches`), assignable/changeable/removable from Add Catch and Edit Catch via the existing Personal Tackle Box browsing view
* The assigned lure survives its `TackleBoxEntry` being later removed from the Personal Tackle Box, and remains resolvable even if the underlying catalog variant is later retired
* Assigned lure shown read-only in Catch Details (manufacturer, model, distinguishing color/variant detail); a catch with no assigned lure renders cleanly

### Catch Photos

* Framework-independent CatchPhoto and PendingCatchPhoto domain models
* Drift persistence (schema version 3, `catch_photos` table, cascade delete from Catches)
* Concrete CatchPhotoRepository (ID generation, sort order, max 5 per Catch, storage/database failure cleanup)
* Application-owned photo storage (`getApplicationDocumentsDirectory`), never a cache directory
* Image processing: orientation correction, downscale to a 2048px longest side (no upscaling), JPEG re-encode at quality 85
* Camera and gallery selection (source-selection dialog, not a nested Bottom Sheet)
* Temporary photo handling during Add Catch (no permanent files/rows before the Catch exists)
* Persistent photo handling during Edit Catch, including confirmed deletion
* Full-screen photo viewer as a normal page (`MaterialPageRoute`), using a `PageView` with a per-page `TransformationController`
* Zoomed photos support one-finger panning in all directions (the `PageView` yields to the `InteractiveViewer` while the current photo is zoomed)
* Page navigation is handed off to the next/previous photo when dragging outward beyond the zoomed image's pan boundary
* Missing/corrupt file placeholders
* Catch deletion cleans up associated photo files before the Catch row is removed
* Partial photo failures never roll back a successfully saved/updated Catch

### Catch Details

* Dedicated read-only Catch Details page (`CatchDetailsPage`), pushed as a normal full-screen page rather than a Bottom Sheet
* Catch List → Catch Details → Edit Catch navigation, with Back/Android-back returning to the Catch list
* Catch list items display a photo thumbnail (or placeholder) alongside species, measurements, and date/time
* Catch information formatting (weight, length, date/time) shared through `catch_formatters.dart`
* Edit and Delete actions available from an overflow menu; Edit reuses the existing Edit Catch editor, Delete reuses the existing confirmation and photo-cleanup flow
* Swipeable 4:3 photo gallery (`PageView`) with a bottom-left page indicator
* `BoxFit.cover`-cropped gallery previews, centered, over a soft dark background
* Full-screen photo viewer reused unchanged for the complete, uncropped image
* Pinch-to-zoom and one-finger panning while zoomed, inherited from the shared photo viewer
* Previous/next photo navigation through edge overdrag while zoomed
* Missing/corrupt image handling
* Immediate UI updates after edits and deletion

### Lure Catalog

* Framework-independent `LureModel`/`LureVariant` domain models, joined into a flat `LureCatalogEntry` read model for all UI-facing queries
* Drift persistence (schema migrated from version 3 to version 4: `lure_models` and `lure_variants` tables, with FK cascade delete and indexes on manufacturer/lureType/lureModelId)
* Concrete, read-only `LureCatalogRepository` (no create/update/delete operations exposed — the catalog is shared reference data, not user-owned data)
* Versioned, idempotent seed reconciliation (`ensureSeeded()`): inserts missing seed rows, corrects stale seed-owned rows while preserving `createdAt`, and never modifies a row whose `seedVersion` is `null`
* Variant retirement (soft-delete via `retiredAt`) instead of deletion, with automatic reactivation if a variant reappears in a later seed version
* Browse, search, and filter by manufacturer and lure type, backed by a single joined query (no N+1)
* Finnish (ä/ö) case-insensitive search via precomputed, Dart-lowercased `searchText` columns
* Free-text search treats `%` and `_` as literal characters, not SQL wildcards
* Filter options (manufacturer/lure type) only ever list values with at least one currently active (non-retired) variant
* Open, extensible lure type/buoyancy codes with Finnish display labels and a humanized fallback for unrecognized values
* Lure Catalog browsing list groups by lure model (one row per model, not per color variant), with a "fully owned" badge/hide-owned filter requiring every non-retired variant of a model to be owned
* Lure Model Details view: model-level information (manufacturer, model, product family, lure type) shown once, followed by a lazily-rendered Color Variants list (image, color, length, weight, owned indicator, add action per variant)
* Opening a model's details always shows its complete, unfiltered variant set — regardless of what search/filter was active on the browsing list — via a dedicated `LureCatalogRepository.getVariantsForModel()` query, unaffected by search/filter state
* Full single-variant detail (including running depth, buoyancy, manufacturer color code) remains reachable by tapping a Color Variant row
* Lure Catalog list and details pages, with loading/empty/error states and image-load fallback to a placeholder
* A small, hand-authored local seed dataset (4 models, 14 variants) — local-seed-only in this milestone; no network access, cloud sync, or user-created entries

### Personal Tackle Box

* Framework-independent `TackleBoxEntry` domain model and `TackleBoxItem` joined read-model, reusing `lure_catalog`'s `LureCatalogEntry` by reference rather than copying catalog data
* Drift persistence (schema migrated from version 4 to version 5: `tackle_box_entries` table, `onDelete: KeyAction.restrict` foreign key to `lure_variants`, unique constraint on `lureVariantId`)
* Concrete `PersonalTackleBoxRepository` performing its own three-table join (`tackle_box_entries` ⨝ `lure_variants` ⨝ `lure_models`), reusing `lure_catalog`'s existing mapper — one query per screen, no N+1
* Duplicate-ownership prevention enforced at both the UI (`isOwned` pre-check) and database (unique constraint) layers
* Explicit "Add to Tackle Box" action reachable per-variant from the Lure Catalog's Color Variants list via a small optional passthrough parameter added to that feature's presentation layer only — the Lure Catalog's domain, data, and repository remain unmodified and fully read-only
* `AddToTackleBoxAction` accepts an optional `initialIsOwned` parameter so a caller that already knows a variant's owned state (e.g. rendering many rows from one already-loaded set) can skip its own `isOwned()` query — avoiding N+1 queries across the Color Variants list; omitted, it queries as before
* Optional personal photo capture (camera or gallery) when adding a lure, explicit "No Photo," or skip entirely; application-owned photo storage mirroring Catch Photos' processing (2048px longest side, JPEG quality 85, atomic write) but with one flat file per entry (no per-entry subdirectory, since at most one photo exists)
* The add-photo dialog distinguishes an explicit "No Photo" choice from a dismissal: tapping outside the dialog, the Android system back gesture, and an explicit Cancel option all cancel the entire add with no `TackleBoxEntry` created — only Camera, Gallery, or explicit "No Photo" complete it
* A narrow, retry-only `attachPhoto` operation lets a user re-attempt a failed photo attach immediately after adding a lure — not a general photo-replace feature
* Personal Tackle Box browsing view grouped by manufacturer, then model, then variant — never a flat one-row-per-variant list
* Owned Entry Detail view: resolved catalog details, personal photo (with fallback to the catalog image), and the Remove action
* Removing an owned entry requires confirmation and deletes both its database row and its personal photo file
* A `TackleBoxEntry` referencing a retired catalog variant remains fully visible, viewable, and removable
* Fully offline; no new external dependencies

* Delete flow verified
* Photo gallery swiping verified
* Portrait and landscape image presentation verified
* Full-screen viewer verified
* Pinch zoom verified
* One-finger zoomed-image panning verified
* Edge navigation between photos verified
* Widget tests completed

### Lure Catalog

* Schema migration (v3 → v4) verified: existing Fishing Spot/Catch/Catch Photo data preserved across the upgrade, new tables usable immediately after
* Domain, database/migration, mapper, search-text, and repository tests completed
* Presentation widget tests completed (list, filter, details, loading/empty/error states)
* Architecture review completed; the 4 Important findings raised (LIKE wildcard escaping, running-depth CHECK constraint, stale out-of-order search results, filter options with no active variants) were all implemented and verified
* flutter analyze passes; all automated tests pass
* Physical Android testing completed

### Personal Tackle Box

* Schema migration (v4 → v5) verified: existing Fishing Spot/Catch/Catch Photo/Lure Catalog data preserved across the upgrade, new `tackle_box_entries` table usable immediately after; verified both in an automated migration test and on a physical Android device
* Domain, database/migration, mapper, storage, and repository tests completed (including `attachPhoto`'s narrow retry behavior and duplicate-prevention at the database layer)
* Presentation widget tests completed (grouped list, owned entry detail, add flow — loading/empty/error states, photo capture, remove confirmation)
* Discovered during widget-test verification: real `dart:io` file operations (photo store/delete) awaited directly inside a `testWidgets()` body hang indefinitely unless wrapped in `tester.runAsync()` — a stricter variant of the real-I/O pattern already used in `edit_catch_bottom_sheet_test.dart`/`catch_photo_viewer_test.dart`
* Architecture review completed; no architectural deviations required in production code
* flutter analyze passes; all automated tests pass
* Physical Android testing completed: add with camera/gallery/no photo, duplicate-add blocked, persistence across the schema-5 migration, remove with file cleanup, airplane mode, both new `MapScreen` entry points

### Assign Lure to Catch

* Schema migration (v5 → v6) verified: `lureVariantId` column added to `catches`, existing data preserved across the upgrade
* Domain, mapper, and repository tests completed for the new optional reference
* Add Catch / Edit Catch widget tests completed: assigning, changing, and removing a lure via the reused Personal Tackle Box picker
* Catch Details rendering verified with and without an assigned lure
* Historical stability verified: removing a `TackleBoxEntry` does not alter a catch that already referenced its `LureVariant`; a retired variant remains resolvable
* flutter analyze passes; all automated tests pass
* Physical Android testing completed

### Lure Catalog UX Improvements

* Lure Catalog browsing list rewritten to group by model (in memory, from the existing `browse()` result); `LureCatalogListItem` renamed and refactored in place to `LureCatalogModelListItem` (no old/new widget left coexisting)
* Lure Model Details (`LureModelDetailsPage`) and the lazily-rendered Color Variants list (`ColorVariantRow`) added; `LureDetailsPage` reused completely unchanged as the full single-variant detail view
* `LureCatalogRepository.getVariantsForModel()` added (a documented TD-018 deviation) so opening a model's details always shows its complete variant set even when the browsing list's active search/filter matched only some of them (FR-6) — verified by a dedicated regression test
* `AddToTackleBoxAction`'s optional `initialIsOwned` parameter lets the Color Variants list render every row's owned state from one already-loaded set, with no per-row query
* Add-photo dialog corrected: tapping outside, the Android back gesture, and an explicit Cancel option all cancel the add with no `TackleBoxEntry` created; only Camera, Gallery, or explicit "No Photo" complete it
* `AutomaticKeepAliveClientMixin` added to `LureCatalogListPage` (a documented TD-018 deviation) — search text, manufacturer filter, hide-owned state, and scroll position all verified to survive switching to the Personal Tackle Box tab and back
* Post-implementation duplication audit completed: no competing grouping logic, navigation path, or leftover pre-refactor widget found
* Architecture review completed; two implementation deviations documented in TD-018 (`getVariantsForModel()`, `AutomaticKeepAliveClientMixin`)
* flutter analyze passes; all automated tests pass
* Physical Android testing completed

### Quality

* flutter analyze passes, with 8 pre-existing/accepted info-level lints (`prefer_initializing_formals`, on constructor parameters whose external names are relied on by callers and cannot be renamed without breaking the public API — see TD-016 Implementation Notes)
* 455 automated tests passing
* Architecture review completed
* Code review completed
* Physical Android testing completed for all currently implemented Android features

## Android Configuration

Configured:

* ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION
* ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION

Background location is intentionally not implemented.

No additional permissions were required for Catch Photos: `image_picker` on Android launches the system camera app and photo picker via intents, neither of which requires a manifest permission declaration from this app.

No additional permissions were required for the Lure Catalog: it reads bundled local assets and the local database only.

No additional permissions were required for the Personal Tackle Box: it reuses the same `image_picker` camera/gallery intents already used by Catch Photos, which require no manifest permission declaration from this app.

No additional permissions were required for Assign Lure to Catch or Lure Catalog UX Improvements: both are presentation/data-layer changes over the existing local database and photo intents, with no new hardware or system capability involved.

---

## iOS Configuration

Added for Catch Photos:

* `NSCameraUsageDescription`
* `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription`

No other iOS configuration changes were required, including for the Lure Catalog and the Personal Tackle Box (the latter's photo capture reuses the same `image_picker` usage descriptions already added for Catch Photos). Physical iOS testing has not been performed (no iOS build target/device in this environment).

---

## Development Workflow

1. ADR (when required)
2. MFS
3. TD
4. Claude Code implementation
5. Architecture review
6. flutter analyze
7. Physical Android testing
8. Git commit
9. Project status update

---

## Known Limitations

* iOS has not been physically tested for any feature in this project.
* The Lure Catalog is local-seed data only: no network access, no cloud sync, and no user-created catalog entries.
* The Personal Tackle Box intentionally does not support search/filtering within a user's own tackle box, editing/replacing an existing personal photo, multiple photos per entry, notes, condition, or purchase information — all explicitly out of scope for MFS-016 (see its Future Extensions section).
* A small number of UI/UX refinements were consciously deferred rather than built speculatively, and are candidates for a later, separate polish task (not a change to MFS-016/TD-016 scope): the empty Personal Tackle Box state relies on standard back navigation to reach the Lure Catalog rather than a dedicated shortcut button, and the grouped browsing list shows the catalog image only — the personal photo is shown on the Owned Entry Detail screen.
* A catch may reference at most one lure (MFS-017); assigning more than one lure to a catch, showing the assigned lure in the catch list, and lure-based statistics are all explicitly out of scope for MFS-017 (see its Out of Scope section).
* Variant filtering within a single model's Color Variants list, favorite variants, stock/availability status, and quick-add shortcuts that skip Lure Model Details are all explicitly out of scope for MFS-018 (see its Out of Scope section).

---

## Next Planned Task

No next milestone has been formally chosen yet — no MFS document has been drafted since MFS-018 (Lure Catalog UX Improvements). See `docs/roadmap.md`'s Current Milestone section for the leading candidate (Lure-Based Catch Statistics), which does not yet have an assigned MFS number or drafted scope.
